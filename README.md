# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This Python script implements a movie recommender system that suggests similar movies based on user input. It utilizes a movie dataset (`movies_data.csv`) and calculates similarity scores between movies to provide personalized recommendations.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `difflib`

## Usage

1. **Movie Data**: The script assumes a dataset named `movies_data.csv` containing movie information and a 'title' column for movie titles.

2. **User Input**: The script prompts the user to enter their favorite movie name.

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - The script utilizes the `difflib.get_close_matches` function to identify movies with titles similar to the user's input.
   - It then calculates similarity scores between all movies in the dataset using a predefined similarity function (replace `similarity` with your actual similarity function).
   - Based on the similarity scores, the script recommends the top 30 closest matches to the user's favorite movie.

## File Structure

- `movies_data.csv`: Dataset containing movie information (including titles).
- `movie_recommender.py`: Python script for movie recommendations.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the prerequisites installed.
2. Place the `movies_data.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the `movie_recommender.py` script in your Python environment.

## Note

- **Data**: The quality and relevance of movie recommendations heavily rely on the chosen similarity function and the completeness/accuracy of the movie dataset. 
- **Similarity Function**:  Replace the placeholder `similarity` with your implementation of a function that calculates movie similarity scores based on appropriate features (e.g., genre, director, actors, keywords).

## Further Enhancements

- Consider incorporating user ratings or reviews to personalize recommendations further.
- Explore advanced recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- Allow users to provide multiple genres or keywords for a broader recommendation scope.
